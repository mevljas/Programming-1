# Shooting exercises
## Heating task
There is no heating task this time, except this one: install everything you need on your computer so you can do your homework. If you have succeeded, check it by writing and running a program that displays the result of  6 times 7.

## Mandatory task
Write a program to calculate the length of a bolt with a cannon (which fires point bullets in an airless space without friction, but leave the trivia). The program requires the user to enter the speed of the projectile (that is, of the mentioned point balls) and the angle at which it is fired. The program calculates and displays how far the bullet will fly.

Aid for the physically helpless: \(s = \frac{v^2\sin 2\phi}{g}\), where \ (s \) is the distance, \ (v \) the velocity of the projectile, \ (\ phi \) is an angle, \ (g \) is the eighth letter of the Slovenian alphabet.

Check this out: a bullet flies the longest if fired at a 45-degree angle. Try how far it goes at an angle of 45 and how far below 46 degrees - after 45 it has to fly longer. And if it flies back at a 50-degree angle (the distance is negative), youâ€™ve certainly broken it somewhere. What, exactly, is wrong, you can quickly squeal a colleague who has already solved the problem, but I recommend that you try to find it yourself - for an exercise in tracking the program. For a hint, you can refer to the Wikipedia section on angles.

You can also check if the program is working properly by calculating by hand how far the bullet flies, which you launch at an angle of 45 degrees at a speed of 10 m / s, and compare the result with what the program returns.

## Additional task
With so little substance, it's hard to think of anything harder, so it's not this time.
