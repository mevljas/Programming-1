## Objectives and competences
The goal of the subject is to teach the basics of
algorithmic thinking and coding in the chosen language
(currently Python).
## Intended learning outcomes
### Knowledge and understanding
Understanding of basic structures (variables, sentences,
loops, functions) and their efficient use for solving
smaller problems. Analysis of a problem and
construction of algorithmic solution; use of appropriate
coding approaches; distinguishing between better and
worse solutions.
### Application
The course teaches the basic programming skills which
represents the foundation for most other courses in the
study programme.
### Reflection
Understanding of basics of algorithmic thinking and
coding.
### Transferable skills
Understanding and use of programming.
